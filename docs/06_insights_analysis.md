## 🧪 Testing

If the specialty selected in the filter has no outpatient waitlist data (i.e., the sum of waitlist for outpatient = 0), the corresponding chart becomes empty. Similarly, if the specialty has no day case or inpatient waitlist data (i.e., the sum of waitlist for day case and inpatient = 0), the related chart also becomes empty. To address this, two measures were created to dynamically check for blank results based on the filter context and display a message in place of the chart. This ensures users are informed about the absence of data instead of encountering blank or empty visuals.

| **Measure** | **Formula** |
|-------------|-------------|
| NoDataLeft | `IF(ISBLANK(CALCULATE(sum(All_Data[Total]),All_Data[Case_Type]<>"Outpatient")), "No data for selected specialty", "")` |
| NoDataRight | `IF(ISBLANK(CALCULATE(sum(All_Data[Total]),All_Data[Case_Type]="Outpatient")), "No data for selected specialty", "")` |

Note that the same field ("Outpatient") has been used for simplicity.

## 🌍 Global Analysis

### 📊 Key Insights vs Action Plan

| **Key Insights** | **Action Plan** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| The total waitlist is extremely high at **709K**, with outpatients contributing **74%** of this number. | Expand outpatient capacity by extending service hours, and redistributing resources from lower-pressure case types. |
| Pediatric specialties (e.g., Orthopedics, Urology) show severe backlogs, especially in the 0–3 month band. | Increase pediatric specialist availability, create dedicated pediatric service units, and prioritize pediatric cases in the 0–3 month band. |
| General specialties like Accident & Emergency, ENT, and Dermatology exhibit high median waitlists. | Strengthen resource allocation for high-pressure specialties, especially in Day Case and Outpatient categories. |
| Most patients are concentrated in the 0–3 month band, especially in the 16–64 age group, across all case types. | Allocate resources to quickly address short-term delays, focusing on the 16–64 age group, and use fast-track processes for critical cases to prevent long-term delays. |
| The 18+ month wait list is still high because the shorter wait periods (like 0-3 months, 3-6 months, etc.) are not being handled properly or in a timely manner. | Tackle shorter wait periods by reallocating resources and speeding up processing to prevent cases from reaching the 18+ month category. |

### 📈 Critical Metrics to Monitor

- Total waitlist numbers by case type (e.g., Outpatient, Inpatient, Day Case).
- Median waitlist by time band, with a focus on the 0–3 month band.
- Specialty-specific waitlists, particularly for Accident & Emergency, ENT, Dermatology, Orthopedics, and Pediatric Urology.
- Age group distribution trends, analyzing how different age groups are represented in the waitlist data over time.

## 💡 Recommendations

### ⚡ Immediate Actions

1. **Outpatient Capacity Expansion**: Focus on the 74% of waitlist that represents outpatients
2. **Pediatric Priority**: Address severe backlogs in pediatric specialties
3. **Short-term Delay Management**: Concentrate on 0-3 month band to prevent escalation

### 🏛️ Long-term Strategy

1. **Resource Reallocation**: Move resources from lower-pressure to high-pressure specialties
2. **Process Optimization**: Implement fast-track processes for critical cases
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Use historical patterns to anticipate future bottlenecks
