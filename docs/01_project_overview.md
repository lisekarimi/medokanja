## 🔍🏥 Project Overview

This project focuses on **improving healthcare systems by analyzing wait lists**, which record individuals awaiting medical treatment, consultations, procedures, or diagnostic tests due to resource limitations, scheduling constraints, or high demand.

### 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Historical Analysis**: Analyze trends from 2018-2021 to identify patterns and enable better planning
- **Specialty-Specific Insights**: Identify medical areas with longest delays for targeted improvements
- **Demographic Analysis**: Understand which age groups experience the most delays
- **Resource Optimization**: Enable data-driven decisions to reduce waiting times

### 📋 Data Overview

The project utilizes publicly available healthcare data focused on patient waiting lists. This dataset is divided into two categories:

- **Inpatients** are individuals who require hospital admission due to the complexity of their treatment or the need for extended monitoring and care. Examples include surgeries requiring post-operative observation or treatment for serious conditions like pneumonia.
- **Outpatients** receive care that does not necessitate overnight hospitalization. Common examples include routine check-ups, diagnostic tests, or minor procedures.
